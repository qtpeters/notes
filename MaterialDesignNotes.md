# Material Design Notes


## Problems
1. I am not currently using dps as the units of measurement
1. Nav/Overflow Menu has no elevation
  a. Nav Menu covers two elements of different elevation: The background ( 0 ) and the Header ( not 0 ..? What is the header Elevation?? )
     That sucks so how do we deal with that?
1. Menu Corners aren't rounded enough
1. Filter's scrollbar is an eyesore
1. Our App bar is totally non-complient
   a. Hamburger menu goes into the top left
   b. Filters are in the way of the hamburger menu's nav drawer
   c. Logo needs to go elsewhere, like the nav drawer.
   d. Search box needs to be replaced by a simple magnifying glass

## Observations
1. The vertical three dots menu ( kabob menu ) is consistently being referred to as the icon for the "overflow menu".  I think 
   that means it's a junk drawer.  The spec always shows it in the top right hand corner all the way because it's for the extra 
   relativly unimportant stuff.
   a. Scott Ortel didn't like the idea of there being a menu there I think...
